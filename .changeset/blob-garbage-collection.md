Reclaim storage from blobs no record references any more. Blob bytes are content-addressed and deduplicated, so a blob can outlive the record that created it (and be shared by several records); garbage collection frees the truly orphaned bytes without touching shared ones.

- `@korajs/store` adds `collectBlobGarbage(store, liveRefs, { dryRun })`, a mark-and-sweep collector. The live set is closed over the reference graph — each live `BlobRef` retains its blob hash, its manifest hash, and every chunk hash the manifest names — so a chunk still referenced by any surviving blob is kept. Mark-and-sweep (not reference counting) is deliberate: it is correct under concurrent edits and CRDT merges, where counts are fragile. The `ContentAddressedBlobStore` interface gains `list()`, implemented by the memory, OPFS, and filesystem stores. `extractBlobRefs(record)` pulls the references out of a materialized record.
- `korajs`: `app.blobs.gc()` sweeps the local blob store against the live records in every collection that has a `blob` field. `{ dryRun: true }` previews what would be collected. Returns a summary (scanned, live, collected, and the collected hashes).
- `@korajs/server`: `KoraSyncServer.getLiveBlobRefs()` returns the live references across all server-side records, so a self-hosted server can GC its central blob store by passing them to `collectBlobGarbage`.

Proven end to end: an orphaned blob is collected after its record is deleted (client and server), a blob is kept while still referenced, and a chunk shared by a surviving blob is never collected.
