`useMutation` reports writes the sync server refuses. In React, Vue and Svelte, `useMutation(fn, { onRejected })` and a `rejected` state (`{ code, message, collection, recordId, operationId, operationIds, reverted, args }`) tell the component that made a write when the server permanently refuses it, even hours later after an offline period, so an app can show "this change was undone, and why" without listening to sync events. One `mutate()` call is one write: every operation it committed, including a delete's cascades and a whole `app.transaction()`; it is reported once. `reverted` is false only for the refusals the device keeps locally (`OUT_OF_UPLINK_SCOPE`, `NODE_ID_MISMATCH`, `SEQUENCE_CONFLICT`). Retriable rejections are not reported. A hook reports nothing after it unmounts, and tracks at most 500 unsynced writes; the app-level `sync:operation-rejected` event and `app.sync.getRejectedOperations()` still report every refusal. Tracking needs `<KoraProvider app={app}>`. Svelte's mutation also gains `subscribeRejected(fn)`.

Two new sync events support it: `sync:operations-acknowledged` (`operationIds` the server stored) and `sync:operations-rewritten` (`reason`, `idMapping`: unsent operations re-authored under new ids by a clock rebase, a node-id rotation or a sequence renumbering).
