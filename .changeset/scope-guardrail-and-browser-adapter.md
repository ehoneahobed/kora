Multi-tenant sync guardrail, and keep the Node SQLite adapter out of browser bundles.

- `@korajs/server` now warns (once per auth provider) when an authenticated session resolves to no sync scopes at all. With a real auth provider configured, "no scopes" means every user syncs every other user's data, so this surfaces a silent cross-tenant exposure. The warning is intentionally skipped for local-first apps (no auth provider) and for `NoAuthProvider` (dev/testing), where unscoped sync is the intended behavior. The message is explicit that declaring `sync` rules in the schema is not sufficient on its own: the per-user scope values must come from the auth provider (for example `KoraAuthProvider`'s `resolveScopes`).
- `korajs`'s adapter resolver no longer lets the Node-only `better-sqlite3` adapter branch get pulled into browser bundles. The dynamic import specifier is now assembled at runtime so bundlers cannot statically follow it, while remaining a real `import()` that still resolves under Node and test runners. Previously a browser build of an app using `korajs` would drag `better-sqlite3` and its native bindings into the graph, forcing apps to add a manual alias/shim to exclude it.
