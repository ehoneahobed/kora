# @korajs/store

## 1.0.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a transport-agnostic request/response protocol for pulling blob chunks over any message channel. This is the wire piece that lets a device fetch a blob's content out of band from a peer that holds it (the sync WebSocket in production, an in-memory pair in tests), rather than inlining bytes into the operation stream.

  - `createRemoteChunkProvider(port)` returns a `ChunkProvider` that requests chunks by hash over a `ChunkMessagePort`, correlates each answer to its request by `requestId`, and times a stalled request out (default 30s) so a dropped response cannot hang a transfer. Because transfers are resumable, a timed-out request is simply retried on the next pull.
  - `serveBlobChunks(port, blobStore)` answers incoming chunk requests from a content-addressed store. A chunk the store does not hold (or whose stored bytes fail their integrity check on read) is reported as unavailable rather than crashing the connection, so a corrupt server-side chunk surfaces to the receiver as a missing chunk instead of a silent bad transfer.
  - `createChunkPortPair()` provides a connected in-memory duplex pair of ports with asynchronous (next-microtask) delivery, modeling a real transport for tests.

  Composes with the existing `receiveBlob`/`prepareBlobForSend` resumable transfer: skip-already-staged chunks are never requested, and only missing chunks cross the port.

- Add a `blob` field type backed by a content-addressed store (data model + store core).

  Files no longer belong in the operation log. A `blob` field carries a small content-addressed reference, and the bytes live in a deduplicated, integrity-checked store keyed by their hash.

  - `t.blob()` fields hold a `BlobRef` (`{ hash, size, mimeType?, filename? }`), a hex SHA-256 content address plus metadata. Values persist as JSON (`TEXT`) and converge by last-write-wins on the reference (the bytes are immutable and deduplicated by hash, so the reference is the only thing that can change).
  - `@korajs/core` exposes `hashBlob`, `createBlobRef`, and `isBlobRef` (reusing the same SHA-256 content addressing as operation ids).
  - `@korajs/store` adds a `ContentAddressedBlobStore` interface and a `MemoryBlobStore` backend: `put` deduplicates identical content (stored once, same hash), and `get` verifies the stored bytes hash to the requested key, throwing `BlobIntegrityError` on corruption rather than returning bad data.

  Proven with unit tests (content addressing, dedup, integrity, buffer-isolation) and validated end-to-end through the real store + sync path (a blob reference round-trips through insert and converges under concurrent replacement). The out-of-band, resumable, chunked byte-transfer channel and persistent backends (OPFS, filesystem/S3) build on top of this reference model.

- Add a persistent filesystem-backed blob store (`@korajs/store/blob-fs`).

  `FilesystemBlobStore` implements the `ContentAddressedBlobStore` contract on disk, so blobs survive process restarts instead of living only in memory. It is a node-only subpath export (like the better-sqlite3 adapter) so `node:fs` never enters a browser bundle.

  - Blobs are stored at `<dir>/<hash[0:2]>/<hash>`, sharded by hash prefix so a single directory never holds millions of entries.
  - Writes are atomic (temp file then rename), so a crash mid-write can never leave a partial blob under a hash that readers would then trust.
  - Same content-addressed guarantees as `MemoryBlobStore`: `put` deduplicates identical content, and `get` verifies the on-disk bytes hash to the requested key (throwing `BlobIntegrityError` on corruption). It drops into the blob transfer path (chunk staging, blob destination) unchanged.

- Reclaim storage from blobs no record references any more. Blob bytes are content-addressed and deduplicated, so a blob can outlive the record that created it (and be shared by several records); garbage collection frees the truly orphaned bytes without touching shared ones.

  - `@korajs/store` adds `collectBlobGarbage(store, liveRefs, { dryRun })`, a mark-and-sweep collector. The live set is closed over the reference graph — each live `BlobRef` retains its blob hash, its manifest hash, and every chunk hash the manifest names — so a chunk still referenced by any surviving blob is kept. Mark-and-sweep (not reference counting) is deliberate: it is correct under concurrent edits and CRDT merges, where counts are fragile. The `ContentAddressedBlobStore` interface gains `list()`, implemented by the memory, OPFS, and filesystem stores. `extractBlobRefs(record)` pulls the references out of a materialized record.
  - `korajs`: `app.blobs.gc()` sweeps the local blob store against the live records in every collection that has a `blob` field. `{ dryRun: true }` previews what would be collected. Returns a summary (scanned, live, collected, and the collected hashes).
  - `@korajs/server`: `KoraSyncServer.getLiveBlobRefs()` returns the live references across all server-side records, so a self-hosted server can GC its central blob store by passing them to `collectBlobGarbage`.

  Proven end to end: an orphaned blob is collected after its record is deleted (client and server), a blob is kept while still referenced, and a chunk shared by a surviving blob is never collected.

- Add out-of-band, resumable, chunked blob transfer (the byte-transfer half of the `blob` field).

  Blob bytes move on a dedicated content-addressed channel, not in the operation log, so large files sync without bloating or re-sending the log.

  - `chunkBlob(bytes, chunkSize?)` splits a blob into content-addressed chunks and produces a `BlobManifest` (blob hash, size, ordered chunk hashes, metadata). Identical chunks collapse to one stored entry while the ordered hash list still reproduces the exact bytes.
  - `reassembleBlob(manifest, chunkStore)` rebuilds the blob with integrity checks at both levels: each chunk is verified on read, and the reassembled whole is verified against the manifest's blob hash.
  - `receiveBlob(manifest, provider, { chunkStore, blobStore })` performs a resumable transfer: chunks already staged (from a prior interrupted transfer) are skipped, each fetched chunk is verified to hash to its expected value before staging, and the completed blob is written to the destination store. The transfer is idempotent, deduplicates repeated chunks, and rejects tampered or missing chunks (`BlobIntegrityError`).
  - `prepareBlobForSend(bytes, chunkStore, options?)` stages a blob's chunks and returns a manifest plus a `ChunkProvider` that serves them.

  The protocol is transport-agnostic (proven with an in-memory provider and property-style resumability/idempotency tests). Wiring it onto the live sync connection, plus persistent chunk/blob backends (OPFS, filesystem/S3), is the remaining integration step.

- Pull a blob's bytes knowing only its reference. This closes the last gap in blob sync: a device that receives a `BlobRef` in a synced record can now fetch the bytes with no separate manifest hand-off.

  - `@korajs/core`'s `BlobRef` gains an optional `manifestHash` — the content hash of the blob's chunk manifest. Because it is a content address like `hash`, the manifest is fetched and integrity-verified over the same channel as the chunks. It rides inside the reference that already syncs in the record, so no new protocol or operation-log surface is needed.
  - `@korajs/store` adds `putBlobForTransfer` (stage chunks + store the full blob + store the manifest as its own content-addressed object, returning a ref that carries `manifestHash`), `resolveBlobManifest` / `fetchBlobManifest` (fetch and verify a manifest by hash before pulling), and the canonical `serializeBlobManifest` / `parseBlobManifest`. The manifest is served over the existing chunk channel with no special casing — it is just another content-addressed object.
  - `korajs`: `app.blobs.put` now stores the manifest and returns a ref carrying `manifestHash`, and `app.blobs.pull` accepts that `BlobRef` directly (resolving the manifest by hash) or an explicit `BlobManifest`. The "attach a file, it appears everywhere" path now needs only the reference from the synced record.

  Proven end to end over the live server relay: a blob authored on device A is pulled on device B from the reference alone — B resolves the manifest by `manifestHash`, then fetches only the chunks it is missing and verifies integrity against the blob hash.

- Keep blobs available after the authoring device goes offline. A self-hosted server can now persist blob bytes centrally, and clients upload the bytes behind their `blob` fields automatically as records sync — so a blob authored on one device is retrievable by others even once the author disconnects.

  - `@korajs/server` gains an optional `persistBlobChunk(hash, bytes)` config. When set, the server advertises central blob storage at handshake, verifies every uploaded chunk against its content hash before storing, and serves stored blobs through the same relay used for peer transfer (`resolveBlobChunk`). With no persistence configured the server stays a pure peer relay, unchanged.
  - `@korajs/store` adds `toServerBlobCallbacks(store)` (and `createMemoryServerBlobStore()`), which adapt any `ContentAddressedBlobStore` — for example a `FilesystemBlobStore` — into the server's read/persist callbacks, so a server can back central blob storage with a durable store without `@korajs/server` depending on `@korajs/store`.
  - `@korajs/sync` adds a `blob-chunk-push` message (client → server upload) and a `blobStorageEnabled` handshake-response flag, both fully represented on the JSON and protobuf wire. `SyncEngine` exposes `isBlobStorageEnabled()` and `uploadBlobChunk()`.
  - `korajs`: when the connected server advertises blob storage, the app automatically uploads a blob's manifest and chunks as its operation is sent — including on reconnect for blobs authored offline — deduplicated per session. No developer wiring.

  Proven end to end: a blob authored on device A auto-uploads to the server as its record syncs, device A disconnects entirely, and device B still pulls the bytes from the server using only the reference from the synced record.

- Clock integrity: protection against wrong device clocks at every layer.

  - HLC now validates remote timestamps BEFORE adopting them (`RemoteClockDriftError`),
    so a far-future timestamp can no longer poison a replica's clock.
  - Local timestamp generation never throws and never blocks writes: drift is
    reported through callbacks and `sync:clock-skew` events instead.
  - The sync handshake now carries `serverTime`; clients measure their own skew,
    pause sync with a new `clock-error` status when the device clock is more than
    60s fast (local writes keep queuing), and warn via events when it is very slow.
  - `SyncStatusInfo` gains `clockSkewMs`; the store's HLC receives the measured
    offset so remote validation works even on devices with wrong clocks.
  - Scaffolded templates render a plain-language banner telling end users how to
    fix their device clock. See the new Clock Integrity guide.
  - Automatic timestamp rebase: after the clock is corrected, the next handshake
    clears the clock block on its own and re-stamps queued never-acknowledged
    operations (new content-addressed ids, causal deps remapped, original order
    preserved) so sync resumes immediately instead of waiting for real time to
    catch up. A new `sync:clock-rebase` event reports `rebasedCount` and
    `maxSkewMs`. Safe because unacknowledged operations are private to the
    device — like rewriting unpushed git commits.
  - Bounded logical counter with carry: the HLC logical counter is capped at
    99,999 (`MAX_LOGICAL`, exported from `@korajs/core`) so serialized timestamps
    always sort lexicographically identically to `HybridLogicalClock.compare`.
    Overflow carries into wallTime (+1ms, counter resets) in `now()`, `receive()`,
    and `advanceTo()`; malformed timestamps (non-integer/negative fields, logical
    past the cap) are rejected with `InvalidTimestampError`
    (`INVALID_TIMESTAMP_FIELDS`) before any clock state changes, both at the
    replica and at server ingest.
  - Canonical binary encoding in op payloads: richtext `Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`
    values are normalized to a tagged `{ $koraBytes: base64 }` form in
    `op.data`/`op.previousData` at operation creation, BEFORE content hashing, so
    the hash input, persisted JSON, and wire payload are the identical value and
    operation ids survive persistence round-trips. Plain-string richtext values
    are untouched (existing operation ids are unaffected); apply paths decode the
    tagged form (and tolerate the pre-fix numeric-key shape from dev databases)
    back to bytes.

- Add `object` and `json` field types that merge as convergent CRDTs.

  Structured data is no longer an opaque last-write-wins blob. Two devices that edit different keys of the same object offline both keep their edits on reconnect.

  - `t.object({ ...nested field schema })`: a structured field whose keys each merge by their own kind (scalars via LWW, nested arrays add-wins, nested objects recursively). Nested values are validated against the declared schema.
  - `t.json<T>()`: a dynamic-key JSON field with the same convergent semantics, resolved structurally, carrying a compile-time shape `T`.

  Merge is a 3-way LWW map with add-wins key presence: per key, one side's write to a key the other left untouched survives; concurrent writes to the same key resolve by HLC (or recurse for nested objects / add-wins for nested arrays); a write always wins over a concurrent delete of that key, so an edit is never silently dropped. The strategy is proven commutative, idempotent, and deterministic with fast-check property tests, and validated end-to-end through the real store + sync path (two devices editing different keys of an object converge). Values persist as JSON (`TEXT`) and cross the existing wire unchanged.

- Persist blobs in the browser and expose a first-class `app.blobs` API, closing the gap between "blobs sync" and "blobs sync with zero developer effort".

  - `@korajs/store` adds `OpfsBlobStore`, a durable content-addressed blob store backed by the browser Origin Private File System (the same storage the SQLite adapter uses). Blobs survive reloads, are sharded by hash prefix, deduplicated, and integrity-verified on read; writes commit atomically so a torn write is never trusted. Its logic runs against a small `OpfsBlobDirectory` port, so it is fully unit-tested without a browser, and `createOpfsBlobStore()` gives the real navigator.storage-backed instance (best-effort requesting persistent storage to resist eviction).
  - `korajs` now holds a blob store on every app and exposes `app.blobs`: `put` (store bytes, returning the `BlobRef` to attach to a record plus the manifest a peer needs to pull), `get` / `has` / `delete` for local bytes, and `pull(manifest)` to fetch a blob's bytes from peers over the live sync connection, fetching only missing chunks and verifying integrity. The backend is chosen by environment — OPFS in the browser, in-memory elsewhere — and is overridable via `blob.store` in `createApp` config. When sync is enabled, the app automatically serves the chunks it holds, so a blob authored on one device is pullable on another with no wiring.

  The default is durable and offline-first: local blob reads and writes work with no connection, and a browser that advertises OPFS but fails to open it degrades to in-memory with a warning rather than failing startup.

  Known boundary: `pull` takes a manifest today. Pulling from a bare `BlobRef` alone (resolving its manifest by hash) is a deliberate next step, since it requires a manifest-distribution decision (embed in the ref, a manifest object addressed by its own hash, or carry it in the operation log).

- Encrypt/hash `secret` fields at rest, end to end. `secret` fields are now secure at rest, not just redacted in traces.

  - The mutation pipeline transforms secret fields to their at-rest form before the operation is built, so plaintext never enters the store, the operation log, or the sync stream. `encrypted` fields are stored as AES-256-GCM ciphertext; `hashed` fields as a one-way salted hash. Verified end to end: after inserting a record, both the materialized column and the op-log JSON contain only ciphertext, never the plaintext.
  - Encrypted secret fields reuse the app's `sync.encryption.key` (a passphrase string or an async provider). A schema with encrypted secret fields but no key configured throws `MissingSecretKeyError` on write rather than silently storing plaintext.
  - `@korajs/core` exposes `transformSecretFieldsForWrite` (the pipeline transform), `revealSecret` (decrypt an encrypted field on demand — reads otherwise return the at-rest form), and `verifySecretValue` (check a candidate against a hashed field, since hashed secrets are one-way and cannot be revealed), plus the `SecretKeyProvider` type.

  Reads return the at-rest form by default; call `revealSecret` at the point of use so plaintext is never spread across query results or subscriptions. This completes the `secret` field: redaction in merge traces (already shipped), the crypto primitives, and now automatic at-rest protection on every write.

### Patch Changes

- Package export hygiene and auth secret-handling hardening.

  - Every published package now exposes `./package.json` in its `exports` map. Previously `require.resolve('@korajs/core/package.json')` (and the same for every other package) failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, which breaks tooling that reads a package's manifest or version at runtime.
  - `createKoraAuthServer` now warns loudly when it falls back to an ephemeral random JWT secret outside production, so a deployment that never set `NODE_ENV=production` no longer silently regenerates its signing key on every restart (which invalidates all existing tokens) without any signal.
  - `KORA_AUTH_SECRET` set to an empty or whitespace-only string is now treated as unset rather than as an invalid secret, so it triggers the intended dev fallback / production guard instead of crashing `TokenManager` with a "secret too short" error.

- Fix silent data loss and divergence on concurrent cross-device edits.

  Two connected devices editing the same record while briefly offline could
  permanently drop one edit and diverge, violating the "no operation is ever
  lost" guarantee. This release closes that bug and every adjacent defect found
  while auditing the apply path:

  - **Per-field LWW register.** Materialized rows now carry `_field_versions`
    (field → last-writer HLC). Remote updates resolve field-by-field, atomically,
    inside the write transaction: deterministic, order-independent, commutative,
    and idempotent. Concurrent edits to different fields both survive; same-field
    conflicts converge to one agreed winner on every node.
  - **Optimistic-concurrency guard for merge results.** Richtext, add-wins-set,
    constraint, and custom-resolver merges are computed from a version snapshot
    and applied only if the row is unchanged; otherwise the merge recomputes from
    fresh state (bounded retries). A local edit can no longer slip between a
    merge's read and its write.
  - **Operation-log integrity.** Merge results are no longer persisted under the
    original operation's content-addressed id. The log always stores the
    canonical operation; only the materialized row reflects merged values.
  - **Insert collisions.** A remote insert targeting an existing record id no
    longer crashes with a primary-key violation (or silently drops the merged
    result on a timestamp tie) — it resolves per-field like an update, with
    `createdAt` converging to the max insert wall time.
  - **Deterministic add-wins ordering.** Concurrent array edits previously
    converged on membership but diverged on element ORDER across devices
    (local-before-remote ordering flips per device). Additions now order
    deterministically, so merged arrays are byte-identical everywhere.
  - **Transaction serialization.** The better-sqlite3 adapter serializes async
    transactions through a mutex, eliminating nested-BEGIN collisions that could
    silently drop a relayed operation applied during a local write.
  - **Atomic increment composition.** Concurrent `op.increment` updates now
    compose to the sum of both deltas through the real sync path (previously one
    side's delta could be lost to last-write-wins, and the merge engine's
    synthetic local operation carried the REMOTE op's intent metadata, doubling
    the remote delta whenever atomic composition ran).
  - **Out-of-order delivery.** An update or delete delivered before its insert
    (reordering transports) no longer vanishes from the materialized row: when
    the insert lands, already-logged operations for that record are folded in
    timestamp order inside the same transaction, matching in-order devices
    exactly. Ops tables gained a `record_id` index to keep record-scoped
    lookups fast.

  Clock rebases re-stamp per-field versions, and backups round-trip them, so
  field-level LWW stays correct across clock corrections and restores.
