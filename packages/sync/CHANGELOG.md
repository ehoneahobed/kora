# @korajs/sync

## 1.0.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- Transfer blob bytes over the live sync connection. Blob fields already synced their content-addressed `BlobRef` through the operation log; now the referenced bytes move out of band over the same WebSocket, so a blob inserted on one device becomes downloadable on another with no second connection and no server-side blob storage required.

  - `@korajs/sync` adds two ephemeral `SyncMessage` variants (`blob-chunk-request` / `blob-chunk-response`) and a `BlobChunkChannel` side channel on the `SyncEngine` (`getBlobChunkChannel()`), mirroring the richtext doc channel. Unlike ephemeral presence messages, blob chunks carry durable user data, so they are fully represented on the protobuf wire (not JSON-only) and round-trip byte-for-byte, with a `hasBytes` flag distinguishing a held chunk from "not held".
  - `@korajs/server` routes chunks between peers with a new `BlobChunkRelay`. By default the server is a pure relay: it forwards a chunk request to peer sessions and routes the first peer's answer back to the requester by `requestId`, never storing or inspecting blob bytes. A new optional `resolveBlobChunk(hash)` server config lets central-store deployments answer chunk requests directly from their own storage, falling back to peer relay on a miss.
  - `korajs` adds `createSyncEngineChunkPort(syncEngine)`, which binds `@korajs/store`'s transport-agnostic `ChunkMessagePort` to the live sync connection, plus re-exports the blob toolkit (`createRemoteChunkProvider`, `receiveBlob`, `prepareBlobForSend`, `MemoryBlobStore`, `createBlobRef`, and related types) so an app can pull and serve blob bytes with `app.getSyncEngine()`.
  - `@korajs/test` devices gain a blob store and `stageBlob` / `pullBlob` / `getBlobBytes` helpers, backing an end-to-end two-device test: a multi-chunk blob authored on device A transfers to device B over the real server relay, resumes fetching only missing chunks after a partial transfer, and verifies integrity against the manifest hash.

  Security note: possessing a chunk hash is itself the capability to request it. Hashes are learned only from `BlobRef`s inside records a peer already received through its scope-filtered sync, and SHA-256 preimage resistance makes guessing one infeasible, so the relay needs no separate blob ACL.

- Keep blobs available after the authoring device goes offline. A self-hosted server can now persist blob bytes centrally, and clients upload the bytes behind their `blob` fields automatically as records sync — so a blob authored on one device is retrievable by others even once the author disconnects.

  - `@korajs/server` gains an optional `persistBlobChunk(hash, bytes)` config. When set, the server advertises central blob storage at handshake, verifies every uploaded chunk against its content hash before storing, and serves stored blobs through the same relay used for peer transfer (`resolveBlobChunk`). With no persistence configured the server stays a pure peer relay, unchanged.
  - `@korajs/store` adds `toServerBlobCallbacks(store)` (and `createMemoryServerBlobStore()`), which adapt any `ContentAddressedBlobStore` — for example a `FilesystemBlobStore` — into the server's read/persist callbacks, so a server can back central blob storage with a durable store without `@korajs/server` depending on `@korajs/store`.
  - `@korajs/sync` adds a `blob-chunk-push` message (client → server upload) and a `blobStorageEnabled` handshake-response flag, both fully represented on the JSON and protobuf wire. `SyncEngine` exposes `isBlobStorageEnabled()` and `uploadBlobChunk()`.
  - `korajs`: when the connected server advertises blob storage, the app automatically uploads a blob's manifest and chunks as its operation is sent — including on reconnect for blobs authored offline — deduplicated per session. No developer wiring.

  Proven end to end: a blob authored on device A auto-uploads to the server as its record syncs, device A disconnects entirely, and device B still pulls the bytes from the server using only the reference from the synced record.

- Clock integrity: protection against wrong device clocks at every layer.

  - HLC now validates remote timestamps BEFORE adopting them (`RemoteClockDriftError`),
    so a far-future timestamp can no longer poison a replica's clock.
  - Local timestamp generation never throws and never blocks writes: drift is
    reported through callbacks and `sync:clock-skew` events instead.
  - The sync handshake now carries `serverTime`; clients measure their own skew,
    pause sync with a new `clock-error` status when the device clock is more than
    60s fast (local writes keep queuing), and warn via events when it is very slow.
  - `SyncStatusInfo` gains `clockSkewMs`; the store's HLC receives the measured
    offset so remote validation works even on devices with wrong clocks.
  - Scaffolded templates render a plain-language banner telling end users how to
    fix their device clock. See the new Clock Integrity guide.
  - Automatic timestamp rebase: after the clock is corrected, the next handshake
    clears the clock block on its own and re-stamps queued never-acknowledged
    operations (new content-addressed ids, causal deps remapped, original order
    preserved) so sync resumes immediately instead of waiting for real time to
    catch up. A new `sync:clock-rebase` event reports `rebasedCount` and
    `maxSkewMs`. Safe because unacknowledged operations are private to the
    device — like rewriting unpushed git commits.
  - Bounded logical counter with carry: the HLC logical counter is capped at
    99,999 (`MAX_LOGICAL`, exported from `@korajs/core`) so serialized timestamps
    always sort lexicographically identically to `HybridLogicalClock.compare`.
    Overflow carries into wallTime (+1ms, counter resets) in `now()`, `receive()`,
    and `advanceTo()`; malformed timestamps (non-integer/negative fields, logical
    past the cap) are rejected with `InvalidTimestampError`
    (`INVALID_TIMESTAMP_FIELDS`) before any clock state changes, both at the
    replica and at server ingest.
  - Canonical binary encoding in op payloads: richtext `Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`
    values are normalized to a tagged `{ $koraBytes: base64 }` form in
    `op.data`/`op.previousData` at operation creation, BEFORE content hashing, so
    the hash input, persisted JSON, and wire payload are the identical value and
    operation ids survive persistence round-trips. Plain-string richtext values
    are untouched (existing operation ids are unaffected); apply paths decode the
    tagged form (and tolerate the pre-fix numeric-key shape from dev databases)
    back to bytes.

### Patch Changes

- Package export hygiene and auth secret-handling hardening.

  - Every published package now exposes `./package.json` in its `exports` map. Previously `require.resolve('@korajs/core/package.json')` (and the same for every other package) failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, which breaks tooling that reads a package's manifest or version at runtime.
  - `createKoraAuthServer` now warns loudly when it falls back to an ephemeral random JWT secret outside production, so a deployment that never set `NODE_ENV=production` no longer silently regenerates its signing key on every restart (which invalidates all existing tokens) without any signal.
  - `KORA_AUTH_SECRET` set to an empty or whitespace-only string is now treated as unset rather than as an invalid secret, so it triggers the intended dev fallback / production guard instead of crashing `TokenManager` with a "secret too short" error.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 5d2afa8: Fix React StrictMode breaking useMutation, useSyncStatus, and useRichText.

  StrictMode's simulated unmount permanently destroyed the useMemo-cached
  controller, so every mutation in a freshly scaffolded app silently failed
  ("Mutation controller is destroyed") and the sync badge stayed stuck on
  "Offline". Controllers are now managed by a StrictMode-safe lifecycle
  helper (useController) that recreates them on remount.

  Also fix `korajs` failing to load in plain Node.js ESM: import
  `protobufjs/minimal.js` with an explicit extension (protobufjs has no
  exports map, so the extensionless subpath only resolves in bundlers).
